# Design structure

This guideline is based on the proposed design at [llm-into-linux](https://github.com/AndresMpa/llm-into-linux)

## Iconography

Provided by [HeroIcons - micro](https://heroicons.com/micro), this one was selected as provider because it's pretty simple to create a .SVG file using those assets, any other image should follow the [images](#images) guidelines

## Assets

### Images

Images should be primarily .SVG, avoid as much as possible .PNG files. Every image for the app should be at [`client/assets/figures`](../client/assets/figures/)

### Fonts

The client uses Roboto, Nunito, Monserrat and sans-seif (Same sequence is the default); the logo must use "Bukhari Script"

## Color palette
